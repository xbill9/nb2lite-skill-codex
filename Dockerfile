# nb2lite-agent — MCP stdio server for gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image.
# Contains only the MCP server and its open-source deps (no Codex client, no keys).
# Run with -i (stdio transport) and pass the key via the environment:
#   docker run --rm -i -e GEMINI_API_KEY xbill9/nb2lite-agent
# Mount your project at the same absolute path so saved-image paths are valid
# on the host: -v "$PWD:$PWD" -w "$PWD"  (see README "Docker" section).
